Chapter 2: Possible Exercise Solutions 
There is no one way to write code. We are all different in how we name our variables etc. Here is a set of solutions that will work.

Exercise 2.2
>>> name = input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? Ivy Chu
>>> name
'Ivy Chu'

Exercise 2.3
>>>
>>> hours = input('Enter hours worked: ')
Enter hours worked: 35
>>> rate = input('Pay rate without $: ')
Pay rate without $: 2.75
>>> pay = hours * rate
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
>>> hours
'35'
>>> int(hours)
35
>>> float(rate)
2.75
>>> pay = int(hours) * float(rate)
>>> pay
96.25
>>>

Better solution maybe.
>>>
>>> hours = int(input('Enter hours worked: '))
Enter hours worked: 35
>>> rate = float(input('Pay rate without $: '))
Pay rate without $: 2.75
>>> pay=hours*rate
>>> pay
96.25
>>>

Exercise 2.4
Pretty simple and strait forward. The difference in that width/2 in version 2 would have yielded 8 – remember floor or integer division. If we really wanted that, we would hve to do width//2 as shown in the last line.
>>>
>>> width = 17
>>> height = 12.0
>>> width/2
8.5
>>> width/2.0
8.5
>>> height/3
4.0
>>> 1+2*5
11
>>> width//2
8
>>>

Exercise 2.5
First we Google formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and get (°C) times 9/5 plus 32 or T(°F) = T(°C) × 9/5 + 32. With that info we should be able to do the following.
>>> 
>>> temp_C = float(input('Enter the temp in Celsius: '))
Enter the temp in Celsius: 35
>>> temp_F = temp_C*9/5+32
>>> temp_F
95.0
